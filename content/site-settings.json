    "heroDescription": "Three women excavating the raw polyphonic traditions of rural Ukraine—the kind of singing that uses chest voice like a weapon, where intervals clash on purpose, where \"beautiful\" was never the point. We're not here to make folk music palatable.",
    "aboutTitle": "The Circle",
    "aboutContent": "Yi Yi practices what ethnomusicologists call \"white voice\" singing (bilyi holos)—an open-throat, chest-register technique that's been passed down in Ukrainian villages for centuries, sounding nothing like the trained voices you hear on opera stages. Think dissonant intervals, yotized vowels, and the kind of heterophony where three people singing the \"same\" melody produces controlled chaos. Caroline handles banjo, drums, and vocals. Sasha and Zoya bring violin and accordion, plus the deep knowledge of this music's architecture. We're committed to the abrasive beauty of village polyphony as a living practice, not a museum piece.",
