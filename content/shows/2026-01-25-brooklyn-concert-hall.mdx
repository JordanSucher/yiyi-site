An evening of powerful Ukrainian village polyphony in one of Brooklyn's most intimate concert venues. Yi Yi presents "Ancestral Echoes" - a journey through the raw, unfiltered vocal traditions that have survived centuries of upheaval.

Witness the chest voice technique that makes audiences hold their breath, where dissonance is not a mistake but a sacred intention. This is folk music stripped of romanticism, returned to its primal power.
