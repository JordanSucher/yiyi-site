Join us for a mystical evening celebrating the winter solstice with ancient Ukrainian polyphonic traditions. This intimate gathering will feature traditional songs of the longest night, woven with the raw power of white voice singing.

Experience the haunting harmonies that have echoed through Ukrainian villages for generations, now reimagined in the heart of Brooklyn. We'll explore the sacred relationship between darkness and light, tradition and transformation.
