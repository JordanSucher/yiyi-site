An intimate gathering in Manhattan's legendary underground music venue. Yi Yi returns to their roots with an evening focused purely on the village polyphonic traditions of Ukraine.

No amplification, no production - just three voices and the ancient power of white voice singing. Experience the raw, uncompromising sound that has moved through generations of Ukrainian women, now channeled through the urban landscape of New York City.

Limited seating. This will be an unforgettable experience.
